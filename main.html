    <h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity refers to the computational complexity that describes the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the length of the input. A more efficient algorithm has lower time complexity, ensuring faster execution.</p>

    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires to execute relative to its input size. It is often expressed using Big O notation, such as O(n), which means the memory requirement grows linearly with input size.</p>
